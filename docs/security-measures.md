# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Azure Resume Challenge project to ensure code quality and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## CodeQL Analysis

CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that automatically discovers vulnerabilities in your code. We've implemented CodeQL scanning in our CI/CD pipeline to identify security issues early.

### Implementation Details

- **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`
- **Trigger Events**:
  - Pull requests to the main branch
  - Pushes to the main branch
  - Monthly scheduled scan (1st of each month)
- **Languages Analyzed**: JavaScript (frontend) and Python (backend)
- **Severity Threshold**: Fails the build on high-severity issues

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

An SBOM is a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of all components used in building software. We generate SBOMs for both frontend and backend code.

### Implementation Details

- **Tool Used**: Syft (by Anchore)
- **Workflow Files**: 
  - `.github/workflows/backend-security-ci-cd.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/frontend-security-ci-cd.yml`
- **Format**: SPDX JSON
- **Output Location**: 
  - Backend: `./api/sbom.spdx.json`
  - Frontend: `./sbom.spdx.json`

## Vulnerability Scanning

We use Grype to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, providing defense-in-depth alongside GitHub's built-in security features.

### Implementation Details

- **Tool Used**: Grype (by Anchore)
- **Workflow Files**: 
  - `.github/workflows/backend-security-ci-cd.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/frontend-security-ci-cd.yml`
- **Severity Threshold**: Fails the build on high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Integration**: Uploads results to GitHub Security dashboard in SARIF format

## Security-Enhanced CI/CD Pipelines

We've integrated the security measures into our CI/CD pipelines to ensure that security checks are performed automatically with every code change.

### Backend Security Pipeline

1. Run tests
2. Generate SBOM with Syft
3. Scan for vulnerabilities with Grype
4. Deploy if all checks pass

### Frontend Security Pipeline

1. Generate SBOM with Syft
2. Scan for vulnerabilities with Grype
3. Build the application
4. Deploy if all checks pass

## Best Practices

- **Defense-in-Depth**: Using multiple security tools provides better coverage
- **Shift-Left Security**: Identifying issues early in the development process
- **Automated Scanning**: Regular automated scans reduce the risk of overlooked vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Tracking**: SBOM generation helps track all dependencies used in the project

## Future Improvements

- Implement secret scanning
- Add container scanning for containerized deployments
- Integrate with additional vulnerability databases
- Implement dependency update automation
